# DeafBot Call Out System

## Overview
The **DeafBot Call Out System** is a Python program designed to assist **Deaf people** in communicating critical messages in real-time. Users can press predefined buttons to trigger specific messages, which will then be spoken aloud by a bot in a voice chat. This system bridges communication gaps, ensuring that important notifications are delivered effectively.

## Features
- **Predefined Buttons**:
  1. **I have triple green**
  2. **I have triple red**
  3. **I have triple banana**
  4. **I have shock**
  5. **I have blue**
  6. **Custom Message (???)**

- **Flowchart Logic**:
  - If the "I have shock" button is pressed:
    1. The system notifies a leader or moderator for confirmation.
    2. Once confirmed, the bot announces "**Activate it now**".

- **Real-time Notifications**: Ensures that critical messages are delivered promptly via voice chat.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
